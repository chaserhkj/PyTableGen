PyTableGen
==========

A Python based program to generate tex table section codes from different data sources.


Interface
=========

Now only a command line interface is usable, script pytbgen.py would read tab separated table data from stdin and prints out generated table code.

Pasting data directly copied from spreadsheet applications would be working fine.

Formatting
==========

Now by default generated table code would have the table in "h" floating mode , have all the data put in the center of the entry, and have an empty caption directive set up for the user to fill in.

In the future, these default behavior may be changeable through command line options or through other user interfaces.
